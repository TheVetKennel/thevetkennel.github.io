    <tr>
      <td>Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA)</td>
      <td>Ductus arteriosus; normal connection in fetus between pulmonary artery and descending aorta → blood bypass lungs directly into systemic circulation. Incr O2 tension and decr prostaglandin E2 after birth trigger closure within hours.\nPDA; Lack of ductal smooth muscle → persistent left-to-right shunt (aortic pressure > pulmonary artery pressure) → volume overload.\nPredis; Females. Poodle, Maltese, GSD.\nRight-to-left shunt if severe as indicates end-stage; fibrosis/hypertension → increased resistance/pressure in pulmonary artery exceeds systemic pressure.</td>
      <td>Echocardiogram: Left atrial/ventricular enlargement, PDA visualization, mitral regurgitation.\nRadiographs: Enlarged left heart, aneurysmal aorta, pulmonary overcirculation.\nPE: Continuous left basilar murmur (washing machine), hyperkinetic bounding pulses.</td>
      <td>Interventional catheterization; coil embolisation/\nvascular plug. (Most PDAs are funnel shaped with base at aorta and tip at pulmonary artery).\nSurgical ligation; If cylindrical PDA. (Or 'Nickel-titanium devices Amplatz Canine Ductal Occluder' for cylindrical PDA in future)\nMedical (CHF): Oxygen, diuretics, ACE inhibitors.</td>
      <td>Favorable with closure.\nPoor for right-to-left shunt.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Vascular Ring Anomaly (Persistent right aortic arch)</td>
      <td>Normal process; Left 4th aortic arch → functional aorta, and the right regresses along with the ductus arteriosum (→ ligamentum arteriosum).\nVascular ring anomaly; Right 4th aortic arch persists → wraps around oesophagus +/- trachea (in combo with ligamentum arteriosum on the left) = constricting ring → oesophageal dilation cranial to constriction → regurgitation.\nPredis; GSD, Irish Setter, Great Dane.</td>
      <td>Radiographs (+/- barium contrast); Megaesophagus, tracheal displacement to left, aspiration pneumonia.\nAngiography; precise confirmation of vascular ring.\nEndoscopy; Narrowing at the level of heart base, mucosal irritation, food buildup in cranial esophagus.</td>
      <td>Surgical ligation of ligamentum arteriosum via left 4th intercostal thoracotomy.\nEsophageal motility may be impaired → upright feeding, soft or liquid diet, multiple small meals</td>
      <td>Good if treated early; residual esophageal dysfunction possible.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD)</td>
      <td>Septal defect → left-to-right shunting → left heart volume overload (after passing thru lungs).\nPredis; Springer Spaniel, Bulldog.</td>
      <td>Echocardiogram: VSD visualization, left heart enlargement.\nRadiographs: Enlarged left heart, pulmonary overcirculation.\nPE: Loud systolic murmur at right sternal border.</td>
      <td>Surgery; patch graft or pulmonary artery banding or interventional device closure.\nMedical; CHF therapy.</td>
      <td>Favorable if small; poor for untreated large defects.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Tetralogy of Fallot</td>
      <td>1. Pulmonic stenosis\n2. Overriding aorta\n3. Ventricular septal defect\n4. Right ventricular hypertrophy\n→ right-to-left shunting → hypoxemia → 2' polycythemia\nPredis; Keeshond, Bulldog, Mini Poodles, Wire Fox Terriers, Scottish Terriers.</td>
      <td>Echocardiogram: VSD, overriding aorta, RV hypertrophy.\nRadiographs: Right heart enlargement, decreased pulmonary vasculature.\nPE: Cyanosis, systolic murmur, exercise intolerance.</td>
      <td>Medical palliative;\nPhlebotomy for polycythemia (blood removal with concurrent fluid replacement).\nHydroxyurea (suppresses bone marrow RBC production) if repeated phlebotomies unachievable.\nSurgery;\nBlalock-Taussig shunt; connects a systemic artery and pulmonary artery to incr bloodflow to lungs. For young/unstable patients (Palliative not corrective)\nPatch graft (corrective) to close VSD.</td>
      <td>Poor if severe.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Atrial Septal Defect (ASD)</td>
      <td>Defect in atrial septum → left-to-right shunting → right heart volume overload.\nPredis; Boxer, Poodle.</td>
      <td>Echocardiogram: Right heart enlargement, ASD visualisation.\nRadiographs: Enlarged right heart, pulmonary overcirculation.\nPE: Grade 2-3/6 Systolic left basilar murmur, split second heart sound.</td>
      <td>Surgery; patch graft or interventional device closure.\nMedical; CHF therapy.</td>
      <td>Favorable if small; poor for untreated large defects.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Atrioventricular Valvular Dysplasia</td>
      <td>Valve malformation → regurgitation (backflow) or stenosis (narrowing of valve orifice, restricting blood flow)\nLeaflets: thickened, shortened, or displaced\nChordae tendineae: abnormal length or absence\nPapillary muscles: abnormal insertion or development\nPredis; Labs, GSD, Great Dane, large breed males predisposed to Tricupsid dysplasia.</td>
      <td>Echocardiogram: Valve thickening, leaflet displacement, chamber dilation, and regurgitant jets\nRadiographs: Heart chamber enlargement, signs of CHF.\nPE: Systolic murmur (right side tricuspid, left side mitral).\nAdvanced tricuspid dysplasia may show right-side heart failure signs (ascites and hepatomegaly).</td>
      <td>Surgery; valve repair/replacement.\nMedical; CHF therapy, antiarrhythmics.</td>
      <td>Variable based on severity.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Peritoneopericardial diaphragmatic hernia (PPDH)</td>
      <td>Failure of septum transversum fusion → Abnormal communication between peritoneal and pericardial cavities → abdominal organs herniate into pericardial sac.\nThe most common congenital pericardial disease in small animals.\nPredis; Weimaraners, Persian & Himalayan cats.</td>
      <td>Radiographs: Cardiomegaly, silhouette between heart & diaphragm.\nPE: Can be asymptomatic. Respiratory distress, exercise intolerance, GIT signs if bowel involved, muffled heart sounds (pericardial space compression).</td>
      <td>Surgery: Hernia repair (herniorrhaphy) via midline laparotomy in symptomatic cases.</td>
      <td>Excellent unless adhesions between abdominal organs and pericardium complicate surgery.</td>
