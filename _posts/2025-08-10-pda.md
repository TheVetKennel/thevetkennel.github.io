## Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA) 🫀

We’re kicking off Canine & Feline Congenital Cardiology (say that five times fast…) with one you absolutely need in your brain’s “always open” tab:

It’s common in dogs.

It’s fixable if caught early.

And it’s an examiner’s favourite (you will see it).

## 1. What is it? 🤔

Stop! Before we talk about the disease, let’s talk about what’s normal.

When a puppy is still a foetus in the womb, it doesn’t breathe air. Its lungs are collapsed, and oxygen comes from the mother through the placenta (cheers, Mum 🫶). Because the lungs aren’t in use, the heart has a shortcut to skip the lungs and send blood straight from the pulmonary artery (the vessel that normally carries blood to the lungs) into the aorta (the main vessel carrying oxygenated blood to the body). This shortcut is called the ductus arteriosus.

Right after birth, things change. The puppy takes its first breath → lungs inflate → oxygen levels in the blood rise → prostaglandin levels drop → the ductus arteriosus is supposed to clamp shut within hours to days.

Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA) happens when this shortcut doesn’t close. “Patent” just means “open.” So PDA = that vessel is still open, allowing blood to flow in a way it shouldn’t (naughty vessel).

Why? In most cases, it’s due to a congenital lack of smooth muscle in the wall of the ductus - meaning it physically can’t constrict properly to close.

## 2. Who gets it? 🐾

PDA is more common in female dogs (let’s hear it for the girls 🎶)

It’s heritable - certain family lines pass it down.

Breeds you’ll see it in a lot (worth memorising for exams):

<ul class="list">
  <li>Miniature Poodle</li>
  <li>Maltese</li>
  <li>German Shepherd</li>
  <li>Yorkshire Terrier</li>
  <li>Shetland Sheepdog</li>
  <li>Collie</li>
  <li>Pomeranian</li>
  <li>Labrador Retriever</li>
  <li>Bichon Frise</li>
</ul>


## 3. Haemodynamics made haemo-easy ⚡

In most cases, blood flows from the aorta into the pulmonary artery through the PDA. Why? Because the pressure in the aorta is normally higher than the pressure in the pulmonary artery.

This is called a left-to-right shunt (because oxygenated blood from the left side of the heart is going back into the right-side circulation).

What does that do?

The lungs get over-circulated so they get more blood than they should be handling.

The left atrium and left ventricle have to pump more volume than they should.

Over time → volume overload → the chambers stretch and enlarge 😬

If left long enough, the high flow into the lungs can cause pulmonary hypertension (high pressure in the pulmonary vessels). Eventually, the pressure in the pulmonary artery can become higher than in the aorta - this flips the flow direction (to become a right-to-left shunt), sending deoxygenated blood into the body (uh oh). This is a bad stage to be in, as surgery isn’t usually an option anymore and so the prognosis ain’t looking too good.

## 4. Clinical picture 🩺

Some dogs have no obvious signs. Others might show:

<ul class="list">
  <li>Poor tolerance for exercise</li>
  <li>Tiredness or lethargy</li>
  <li>Cough</li>
  <li>Trouble breathing (dyspnoea)</li>
</ul>


On physical exam, the “gold nugget” findings are:

<ul class="list">
  <li>Continuous “washing machine” murmur, heard best at the base of the heart on the left side. “Continuous” means you hear it during both systole and diastole.</li>
  <li>Sometimes a second murmur from mitral valve leakage.</li>
  <li>TBounding pulses - the difference between systolic and diastolic pressure is large, so the pulse feels extra strong.</li>
</ul>

If congestive heart failure has developed, you may see laboured breathing or other signs of fluid build-up.

## 5. How we diagnose it 🔍

Echocardiography (heart ultrasound)
<ul class="list">
  <li>Enlarged left atrium and left ventricle.</li>
  <li>A visible swirl of continuous blood flow in the main pulmonary artery.</li>
  <li>PDA often has a funnel shape with the narrow end on the pulmonary artery side.</li>
  <li>Mitral regurgitation is common.</li>
</ul>

Electrocardiography (ECG)
<ul class="list">
  <li>Tall R waves (suggesting left ventricular enlargement).</li>
  <li>Wide P waves (suggesting left atrial enlargement).</li>
</ul>


Thoracic radiographs (chest X-rays)
<ul class="list">
  <li>Can look normal in mild cases.</li>
  <li>May show enlarged left heart chambers.</li>
  <li>Sometimes an aneurysmal bulge of the descending aorta.</li>
  <li>Evidence of over-circulated lungs (possibly with pulmonary oedema).</li>
</ul>


Blood pressure
<ul class="list">
  <li>Systolic pressure often normal.</li>
  <li>Diastolic pressure decreased (widening the gap between systolic and diastolic values).</li>
</ul>


## 6. Treatment options 💊

Interventional catheterisation: device occlusion (coil, vascular plug, Amplatz ductal occluder).

Surgical ligation of PDA.

Medical management only if CHF present or PDA can’t be closed (diuretics, ACE inhibitors, oxygen, inotropes).

## 7. Prognosis 📈

Small PDA: may never cause signs, but closure still considered.

Moderate/large PDA: clinical signs likely → excellent prognosis if closed early. Untreated = shortened lifespan.

Right-to-left PDA: poor prognosis; manage symptoms (phlebotomy/hydroxyurea for polycythaemia), no closure.

## 8. Key takeaways 🔑

PDA = leftover fetal vessel that should close but doesn’t.

Left-to-right shunt → lung overcirculation → LA/LV volume overload → CHF risk.

Right-to-left shunt = late-stage, poor prognosis, closure contraindicated.

Classic signs: continuous murmur, bounding pulses, echo funnel shape.

Treat early for the win.

Exam pattern recognition: A young, small-breed female dog with a continuous left basilar murmur and bounding pulses = 🛎 alarm bells for PDA!!! 🛎

## Quick Reference (No funny Business)

Type: Common congenital heart defect in dogs

Signalment: ↑ females, heritable

Cause: Congenital absence of ductal smooth muscle → failure to close

Shunt: Usually left → right (aorta → pulmonary artery)

Breeds: Miniature Poodle, Maltese, GSD, Yorkie, Sheltie, Collie, Pomeranian, Labrador, Bichon

Clinical signs: Often none. Exercise intolerance, lethargy, cough, dyspnoea

Physical exam:

    Continuous left basilar murmur
    
    Possible systolic left apical murmur (mitral regurg)

    Bounding pulses (↑ systolic–diastolic gap)

    Dyspnoea (if CHF)

Diagnosis:

    Echo: LA/LV enlargement, continuous PA flow, funnel-shaped PDA, ± MR

    ECG: Tall R waves (LV enlargement), wide P waves (LA enlargement)

    X-ray: LA/LV enlargement, aneurysmal descending aorta, pulmonary overcirculation ± oedema

    BP: Normal systolic, ↓ diastolic

Treatment:

    Interventional closure (coil, plug, ductal occluder)

    Surgical ligation

    CHF management (O₂, diuretics, inotropes, nitroglycerin, ACEi)

Prognosis:

    Small PDA: Good, may remain asymptomatic

    Moderate/large PDA: Good if closed early; shortened lifespan if untreated

Right-to-left PDA:

    Cause: Pulmonary hypertension

    Signs: Hypoxaemia, exercise intolerance, collapse, tachypnoea, dyspnoea, ascites

    Polycythaemia → phlebotomy or hydroxyurea

    Closure contraindicated → severe hypoxaemia & death

    Prognosis: Poor
