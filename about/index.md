  <h2>Hello there and welcome to The Vet Kennel</h2>
  <p>Who am I? I’m a UK licensed vet and the human behind The Vet Kennel. After scrambling my way through vet school, I decided it would be a good idea to sit the most nefarious veterinary exam of all time; the NAVLE!! All this to find work in the beautiful land of the bald eagle and cheese you can spray out of a can. Just one problem... I have forgotten everything! I have planted this site today (August 2025) and with a bit of watering and fertiliser (origin of the fertiliser will not be disclosed), I hope to nurture it into a flourishing jungle of accessible learning. This site is a cozy corner for <strong>NAVLE prep</strong>, <strong>vet student tools</strong>, and <strong>bite-sized explainers</strong> for the topics we all secretly google at 2am.</p>

  <h2>What you’ll find here</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>NAVLE Anki flashcards</strong> — high-yield decks designed around active recall and spaced repetition.</li>
    <li><strong>Printable tools</strong> — study planners, SOAP templates, placement logbooks, and more.</li>
    <li><strong>Notebook</strong> — short, readable posts that turn dense topics into checklists and “ohhh that makes sense” moments.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why I built this</h2>
  <p>Studying is hard enough without hunting for resources. I wanted everything in one place — structured, trustworthy, and actually usable. If it helps you pass an exam or make a better plan for a patient, that’s a win.</p>

  <h2>Start here</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Read the latest in the <a href="{{ '/notebook/' | relative_url }}">Notebook</a>.</li>
    <li>Browse resources in the <a href="{{ '/library/' | relative_url }}">Library</a>.</li>
    <li>Say hello via <a href="{{ '/contact/' | relative_url }}">Contact</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><em>P.S. I’m always improving the decks and tools. If you spot an error or want a resource made, send me a note — I’d love to hear from you.</em></p>
