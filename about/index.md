    <h2>Hello there and welcome to The Vet Kennel</h2>
  <h2>Who am I?</h2>
  <p>I’m a UK licensed vet and the human behind The Vet Kennel. After scrambling my way through vet school, I decided it would be a good idea to sit the most nefarious veterinary exam of all time; the NAVLE. I have planted this site today (in August 2025) and with a bit of watering and fertiliser (source of the fertiliser will not be disclosed), I hope to nurture it into a flourishing jungle of <strong>easy, accessible learning<strong> open to everyone.</p>

  <h2>What you’ll find here</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Notebook; friendly, readable notes that turn dense topics into “ohhh that makes sense” moments.</li>
    <li>Anki flashcards; high-yield decks designed for active recall and spaced repetition.</li>
    <li>Printable tools; study planners, SOAP templates, placement logbooks, and whatnot.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why I built this</h2>
  <p>I wanted to cultivate a safe, cozy corner to help me (and hopefully you) to prepare for the NAVLE, written without assuming any prior knowledge. Every tool and note is based in the 2 ICVA documents that outline the NAVLE syllabus; Species and Diagnoses, and Competency Domains. I found that although Vetprep and Zuku are great for example questions, I'm incredible at guessing MCQ answers (humble) and so I felt like the information wasn't actually going into my brain. With indepth explanations for each diagnosis, along with active recall flashcards, I hope to cement these millions of little facts into my brain. When all is said and done, my aim is to make at least 1 person feel more confident about sitting the NAVLE, even if that person is me.</p>
