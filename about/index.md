  <h2>Hello and welcome to The Vet Kennel</h2>

  <h2>Who am I?</h2>
  <p>I’m a UK-licensed vet and the human behind The Vet Kennel. After scrambling through vet school, I decided to tackle the most notorious exam of all; the NAVLE (North American Veterinary Licensing Examination). I planted this site in August 2025; with a bit of watering and fertiliser (source not disclosed), I aim to grow it into a flourishing jungle of quality study resources.</p>

  <h2>Why I built this</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>A cozy, no-judgement study corner.</strong> Everything is written without assuming prior knowledge and grounded in the two ICVA documents that outline the NAVLE syllabus: <em>Species &amp; Diagnoses</em> and the <em>Competency Domains</em>.</li>
    <li><strong>Not just guessing MCQs.</strong> I’m annoyingly good at educated guesses, so while VetPrep and Zuku are great for practice questions, I wanted deeper understanding for placements and real life. In-depth explanations + active-recall flashcards help the millions of tiny facts actually stick.</li>
    <li><strong>Confidence over cramming.</strong> If this helps even one person feel calmer and more prepared to sit the NAVLE — even if that person is me — it’ll be worth it.</li>
  </ul>

    <h3>Do you know what you're talking about?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Yes (I hope). In addition to being a vet, I also cross-check all facts with;

Saunders Comprehensive Review for the NAVLE

Lecture notes from the BVetMed course at the Royal Veterinary College LondonEvidence-based:</strong> Anchored to ICVA guidance; cross-checked with primary vet texts and reputable guidelines.</li>
      <li><strong>Active recall first:</strong> Notes become Anki prompts; summaries become checklists; everything nudges retrieval, not re-reading.</li>
      <li><strong>Clear references:</strong> Sources listed where relevant so you can verify, read deeper, and cite confidently.</li>
    </ul>
