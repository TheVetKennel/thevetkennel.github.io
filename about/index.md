  <p><em>Short version: I’m a UK-licensed vet who is sitting the NAVLE in March 2026. I make clear, high-yield study resources so NAVLE revision feels less huge and scary</em></p>

  <h3>Who are you?</h3>
  <p>A UK-licensed vet (MRCVS) with a deep love for Anki, concise summaries, and opinions about headings. I'm growing The Vet Kennel to help me organise my revision without having to wrestling infinite scrawled notes from my time at vet school.</p>

  <h3>What is this?</h3>
  <p>A safe, cozy corner for <strong>evidence-based, accessible</strong> vet study resources, with no prior knowledge assumed. My website may be basic (I suck at technology) but it's teeming with gold nuggets of veterinary info, all delivered with some personality and not just regurgitating a textbook.</p>

  <h3>How do I use it?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Peruse the <a href="{{ '/notebook/' | relative_url }}">Notebook</a> to find friendly, comprehensive explainers when you need clarity on a diagnosis.</li>
    <li>Grab the goods from the <a href="{{ '/library/' | relative_url }}">Library</a> when you’re ready to practice with concise, exam-focused active-recall flashcard decks. Or, if you crave organisation during your hectic clinical rotations; find study planners, SOAP templates, placement logbooks, and whatnot.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Do you know what you're talking about?</h3>
  <p>I think so! Everything here is mapped to the ICVA <em>Species & Diagnoses</em> and <em>Competency Domains</em>. I cross-check content with Merck Veterinary Manual, Saunders Comprehensive Review for the NAVLE, Vetprep, Zuku, Merck Veterinary Manual, as well as evidence-based peer reviewed studies found in ResearchGate, AVMA Journals, PubMedCentral, in addition to my own lecture notes from the Bachelor of Veterinary Medicine course taught at the Royal Veterinary College London. If you read anything that sounds off, please do drop me a message and I will investigate.</p>


  <h3>Can I request something?</h3>
  <p>Yes, please. Tell me what would actually help you and I would be happy to make that a reality: <a href="{{ '/contact/' | relative_url }}">Contact</a>.</p>

  <h3>Where do I start?</h3>

    <li>Study tools → <a href="{{ '/library/' | relative_url }}">Library</a></li>
  </ul>
